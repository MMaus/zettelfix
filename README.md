2022 03 11: Sorry that this project is pausing for now...  
I just switched my attention to another project, which is ML (no github repo in the near future - just getting started).  
The current state of this project is far from finished, not even close to an alpha version. Despite being deployed at zettelfix.de and used regularly by me, I consider it still as experimental draft - my TODO list just for this project is overwhelming, and although I enjoy improving this, I also want to progress on my other projects - so this may become a dead end street.  
Sorry for this.
